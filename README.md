## How to play

Learn the basic rules at https://m.wikihow.com/Play-Backgammon

Our gameboard is built to be played by clicking on pieces, and then clicking on the space to move them to. Once all of your pieces are in your home base quadrant, click on them and then click on your personal Base button to win the game! Watch out for any pieces sitting in your jail cell as those need to be moved out first before any other piece can.
