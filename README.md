## How to play

Learn the basic rules at https://m.wikihow.com/Play-Backgammon

Our gameboard is built to be played by clicking on pieces, and then clicking on the space to move them too. Once all your pieces are in your homebase, click on them and then click on your personal Base button to win the game! Watch our for any pieces sitting in your jail cell, those need to be moved out first before any other pieces can.
